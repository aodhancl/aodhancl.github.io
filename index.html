<p class="title"> Agile Meeting</p>

<div class="box">
  <p style ="text-align: center; ;">
    We looked at the agile working methodology which focuses on improving the process of making a product to make the product 
    better in the long term. Agile looks at improving communication among other things. We worked at a team building game where 
    we had to construct a potato head based off a prompt, shareholders would change the idea of what they wanted their product 
    to be throughout the stage of building, so we had to adapt. We used a kanban board to break down the construction of our 
    potato head into smaller tasks we could manage. We had three sections: to do, doing and done. We had to move each task into 
    the corresponding section to ensure we were being efficient in our task. We then did retrospecting to see what could be 
    improved on. Our main problem was not getting specifics off the shareholder before constructing the potato head which resulted 
    in lots of change occurring. I learnt a lot in this workshop about the Agile methodology and how to be efficient and keep effective 
    communication between you and your team but I did feel that it went on for a long time and 
    could have been shortened at times.

<p class="title"> GIT Workshop</p>

<div class="box">
  <p style ="text-align: center; ;">
    We were taught the basics of git which is a version control tool used to manage
    versions of a repo, git has a website called github where repositions can be forked
    and added onto by other developers. We looked at how to clone a reposition onto
    your local device, make changes and then commit and push them to your main github
    repoisition. I found it very interesting but hard to grasp at first but I ended up 
    getting it and I am able to use it now.

<p class="title">  MicroBits</p>

<div class="box">
  <p style ="text-align: center; ;">
    We were shown a microbit which is tiny, pocket sized computer with lots of 
    modules on it such as a compass and accelerometer, it comes with a computer
    coding software which is very easy to use and can be coded with simple block coding,
    I really enjoyed this workshop as we were let off to experiment with the device and
    code whatever we wanted. There were free resources we could use to help us as
    well which made it easier.

<p class="title"> Team Building Day</p>

<div class="box">
  <p style ="text-align: center; ;">
    This was one of my faourite days, we had a full day to construct a 
    rollercoaster out of various items such as: straws, paper, tape and
     some other similar things, we had to take it slow and plan it out.
     we had free reign on when we had to work on it which I enjoyed because
     it showed us how we had to manage our "work-life" balance and make sure we
     didn't burn our which ended up happening to one of the teams. Our rollercoaster
     came second.

<p class="title">  College Talk</p>

<div class="box">
  <p style ="text-align: center; ;">
    We had a very informationial talk about college life and how to get into the
    trade of a software engineer and i found it very useful as this is a 
    possible career path I would like to take and I got to ask questions
    which helped me a lot.

<p class="title">  Pool Tournament</p>

<div class="box">
  <p style ="text-align: center; ;">
    A TY in our group organised a pool tournament, two interns joined in and
    i really enjoyed it as we all were able to talk and bond around the pool table
    I think this should be an actual activity in the timetable at the start of the
    week so everyone can get to know each other. I think both tys and emplyees should
    be involved. I also loved it because I ended up winning.

<p class="title">  Python Workshop</p>

<div class="box">
  <p style ="text-align: center; ;">
    We were shown a python game in github, we had to fork it and clone it
    which tested our knowledge of git. After we had cloned it we had to test it
    fix any bugs we found, I really enjoyed this and have had past experience in
    python so I didn't find it too difficult but I saw other people struggling.

<p class="title">  Race Day</p>
<div class="box">
  <p style ="text-align: center; ;">
   We had to program and test robots and race them around a track, I really enjoyed
   this final task as it put all the things we had learnt from the agile
   to programming into test. Overall it was a good end to the work experience.

<p class="title"> Summary</p>
<div class="box">
  <p style ="text-align: center; ;">
   The experience that Red Hat provided us with was unbeliable, I had so much fun 
   and learnt so much. It helped me decide that being a software engineer is a career
   path I might look into in the future. The staff were so helpful and so kind
   and they were always checking in and made me feel at home. <br>
   Thank you so much to the Red Hat team!
