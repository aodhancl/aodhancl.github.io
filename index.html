<p style="font-weight: bold;"> Agile Meeting</p>

<div class="box">
  <p style ="text-align: center; ;">
    We looked at the agile working methodology which focuses on improving the process of making a product to make the product 
    better in the long term. Agile looks at improving communication among other things. We worked at a team building game where 
    we had to construct a potato head based off a prompt, shareholders would change the idea of what they wanted their product 
    to be throughout the stage of building, so we had to adapt. We used a kanban board to break down the construction of our 
    potato head into smaller tasks we could manage. We had three sections: to do, doing and done. We had to move each task into 
    the corresponding section to ensure we were being efficient in our task. We then did retrospecting to see what could be 
    improved on. Our main problem was not getting specifics off the shareholder before constructing the potato head which resulted 
    in lots of change occurring. I learnt a lot in this workshop about the Agile methodology and how to be efficient and keep effective 
    communication between you and your team but I did feel that it went on for a long time and 
    could have been shortened at times.

<p style="font-weight: bold;"> GIT Workshop</p>

<div class="box">
  <p style ="text-align: center; ;">
    We were taught the basics of git which is a version control tool used to manage
    versions of a repo, git has a website called github where repositions can be forked
    and added onto by other developers. We looked at how to clone a reposition onto
    your local device, make changes and then commit and push them to your main github
    repoisition. I found it very interesting but hard to grasp at first but I ended up 
    getting it and I am able to use it now.

<p style="font-weight: bold;"> MicroBits</p>

<div class="box">
  <p style ="text-align: center; ;">
    We were shown a microbit which is tiny, pocket sized computer with lots of 
    modules on it such as a compass and accelerometer, it comes with a computer
    coding software which is very easy to use and can be coded with simple block coding,
    I really enjoyed this workshop as we were let off to experiment with the device and
    code whatever we wanted. There were free resources we could use to help us as
    well which made it easier.
